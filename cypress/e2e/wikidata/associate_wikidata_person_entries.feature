Feature: Note creation should have description if wikidata is a person
  As a learner, I want to to create a note. If the note is a person I want the birthday and country
  to be included in the description of the new note.

  Background:
    Given I've logged in as an existing user
    And there are some notes for the current user
      | title  |
      | People |

  Scenario Outline: New Note creation and person wikidata is selected
    Given Wikidata.org has an entity "<wikidataId>" with title "<person name>"
    And Wikidata.org has an entity "Q12345" with title "<country of origin>"
    And Wikidata.org entity "<wikidataId>" is a person from "Q12345" and birthday is "<birthday>"
    When I create a note belonging to "People":
      | Title         | Wikidata Id  |
      | <person name> | <wikidataId> |
    Then I should see the note description on current page becomes "<description>"

    Examples:
      | person name     | wikidataId | country of origin | birthday              | description              |
      | Wang Chien-ming | Q706446    | Taiwan            | +1980-03-31T00:00:00Z | Taiwan, 31 March 1980    |
