Feature: associate wikidata ID to note
    As a learner, I want to associate my note to wikidata IDs, so that I can
    * keep my concepts in sync with the rest of the world
    * get extensive content from Wikidata, Wikipedia and other knowledge base
    * Identify the duplicate note in my own notebooks and the circles I'm in

  Background:
    Given I've logged in as an existing user
    And I have a note with title "TDD"

  Scenario Outline: Associate note to wikidata with validation
    Given Wikidata.org has an entity "<id>" with title "<wikidata title>"
