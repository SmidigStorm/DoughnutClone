Feature: Repetition Link Quiz
  As a learner, I want to use quizzes in my repetition to help and gamify my learning.

  Background:
    Given I've logged in as an existing user
    And there are some notes for the current user
      | title | skipReview | testingParent |
      | Space | true       |               |
      | Moon  | true       | Space         |
      | Earth | true       | Space         |
      | Mars  | true       | Space         |
    And there is "a specialization of" link between note "Moon" and "Earth"

  Scenario Outline: "Belongs to" question
    Given It's day 1, 8 hour
    And I do these initial reviews in sequence:
      | review_type | title |
      | link        | Moon  |
    When I am repeat-reviewing my old note on day 2
    Then I should be asked link question "Moon" "a specialization of" with options "Earth, Mars"
    When I choose answer "<answer>"
    Then I should see that my answer <result>

    Examples:
      | answer | result          |
      | Mars   | "Mars" is wrong |
      | Earth  | is correct      |
