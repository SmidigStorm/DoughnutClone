Feature: Bazaar sharing
  There should be a bazaar in Doughnut that people can share their public notes,
  and others can subscribe to their notes.

  Background:
    Given I've logged in as an existing user

  Scenario: Contributing To Bazaar
    Given there are some notes for the current user
      | title    | description               | testingParent |
      | Shape    | The form of something     |               |
      | Square   | four equal straight sides | Shape         |
      | Triangle | three sides shape         | Shape         |
    When I choose to share my notebook "Shape"
    Then I should see "Shape" is shared in the Bazaar
