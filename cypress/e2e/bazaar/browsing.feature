Feature: Bazaar browsing
  Part of the bazaar should be visible to everyone.

  Background:
    Given there are some notes for existing user "old_learner"
      | title           | description                      | testingParent | hideTitleInArticle | showAsBulletInArticle |
      | Shape           | The form of something            |               | false              | false                 |
      | Rectangle       | four equal straight sides        | Shape         | false              | false                 |
      | Triangle        | three sides shape                | Shape         | false              | false                 |
      | Square          | a square but big                 | Rectangle     | false              | false                 |
      | In OOP          | a square is not a Rectangle      | Rectangle     | true               | false                 |
      | interface       | their interfaces are different   | In OOP        | true               | true                  |
      | precondition    | square has stronger precondition | In OOP        | true               | true                  |
      | Shapes are good |                                  | Shape         | false              | false                 |
    And there is "a specialization of" link between note "Square" and "Rectangle"
    And notebook "Shape" is shared to the Bazaar

  Scenario: Browsing as non-user
    When I haven't login
    Then I should see "Shape" is shared in the Bazaar
    And there shouldn't be any note edit button for "Shape"
    When I open the notebook "Shape" in the Bazaar
    Then there shouldn't be any note edit button for "Rectangle"
    And I should see "Bazaar" in breadcrumb
    When I click the child note "Rectangle"
    And I should see it has link to "Square"
